# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  The project was to create a program that took user input and used that input to do one of three things: produce a list of items purchased in a grocery store in one day along with the number of times each item was purchased, produce the number of times a single item was purchased in one day, or produce a histogram of the items purchased in a single day, along with code to allow the user to exit the program instead. The program reads data from a list, and, in the case of the histogram, also writes data to a .dat file. It also uses a while loop in main in order to allow the user to perform multiple tasks until they choose to exit the program.


What did you do particularly well?

  I feel that the main thing I did particularly well was make the code maintainable while still keeping all necessary functionality. I focused on writing comments to explain the function of the code, as well as making sure to use white space effectively and using seperate functions where possible to keep the main() method readable by not having too much code in there.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I feel that one thing I could do to enhance the code would be to move more of the code from main() into seperate functions. Performance would not see any benefit, but it would allow for me to more easily maintain the code because it would be even more readable. If I did that, then I might see areas for improvement that are not apparent to me as the code is now.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The Python code was trickier for me to write than the C++ code. The main reason for this was that while I have experience with Python, I had not coded in Python in a few months, whereas I have been using C++ fairly often. I overcame this by checking the documentation for Python, as well as course material from previous courses to refresh my memory on things such as syntax and built-in Python functions. I think one of the biggest resources I am keeping in mind is the official documentation for each language I am coding in. Most languages have documentation on the internet from my experience, so I think checking that more often would be helpful for me.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  I think the biggest skill from this project that would be particularly transferable to other projects would be integrating multiple languages. Most really big projects I have seen use multiple languages because they all have their own pros and cons. Because of this, learning how to integrate multiple languages is essential for big projects, and I would imagine it will be essential for course work in upcoming classes.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making the code both as modular and as neat as I possibly could in the given timeframe while keeping functionality in mind. Where I could easily take code out of main and put it into other functions, I did that. I also left comments throughtout both the Python and C++ code in order to document what was going on in the code. I also used white space to make code easier to read so that it would be maintainable later.
